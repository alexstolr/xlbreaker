Problem description: As an Israeli resident, i often encounter a problem of my post mail being lost due to changed address or ILPost poorly functioning. I would like to have a solution to help retrieve this mail.

Suggested solution: A social network which will incentivize passerbys who encounter an undelivered mail to notify the recepient about the mail.
the incentive will be a: payment ax of x paied amount by recepient ( where a < 1) other possibility would be to offer other compensation.
our company could also benefit by providing a delivery of the lost and found mail to the recepient. by following freemium vs premium etc...
